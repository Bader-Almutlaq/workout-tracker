## Next milestones (tasks are written when the milestone starts)

- **On hold:** chart changes, until the owner has reviewed the charts (`docs/PLAN.md` → R0).
- **Owner's roadmap R1–R6** (`docs/PLAN.md` → *Roadmap*): measurements page, bigger library, exercise variants, programs, per-workout analytics, live-workout polish. Designed with the owner before tasks are written.
- **W6 (rest): Intensity × volume.** Rep-range mix, RIR histogram, intensity–volume map (`docs/PLAN.md` → analytics item 3).

## Done milestones

- **W0:** web skeleton: SQLite in a worker on the phone, migrations with snapshot, offline support, tokens, tabs, Appearance (branch `web`, 2026-10-30).

## Archived: native app (2026-10-29 → 2026-10-30)

Tasks T-001 to T-012 built M0–M3 natively in Swift. That code is the spec for W1–W3 (`reference/native/`, full history on branch `native-archive`). Their briefs stay in this folder for reference; T-004, T-005, T-009 and T-010 describe screens that W2–W3 rebuild, and T-010's number pad and set-row spec carries over unchanged.
