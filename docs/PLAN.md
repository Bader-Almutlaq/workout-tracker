# Workout Tracker: build plan

A personal iPhone workout tracker (an offline web app on the Home Screen) to replace Strong. It keeps 4 years of Strong history, has a much larger exercise library, makes building workouts easy, and gives deep, science-based analytics. Research behind every decision: `reports/Workout tracker app research.md` (details in `research_notes/`).

## Principles

- **Measure, don't prescribe.** The app records and calculates. Training decisions stay with the user. Progression rules are opt-in, per exercise, defined by the user.
- **Literature, not hype.** Every metric must trace to a cited source in the report, or be labelled as a descriptive heuristic.
- **Excluded:** AI features, exercise videos/animations, social, streaks, celebrations, accounts, cloud.
- **Not cluttered.** Logging needs 2–3 taps per set, with last session's numbers always visible inline.
- **Data is irreplaceable.** Never lose a set. One-tap backups to iCloud Drive, with the last-backup date always visible (see `docs/DATA.md`). Keep the original Strong CSV forever.
- **Engineering standards** are in `AGENTS.md`; agent workflow in `docs/agents/WORKFLOW.md`; tasks in `docs/tasks/BOARD.md`; structure in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`; visual system in `docs/DESIGN.md` (Linear-inspired).

## Platform and install

- **An offline web app on the iPhone Home Screen** (open the site in Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen). It runs full-screen like an app, works with no connection, and never expires. Switched from native on 2026-10-30 (see `docs/DECISIONS.md`).
- All data stays on the phone, in the Home Screen app's private storage. **Deleting the Home Screen icon deletes the data**, so backups matter (see `docs/DATA.md`).
- Hosted on GitHub Pages at https://bader-almutlaq.github.io/workout-tracker/ (code only, never data). Publish with `make deploy`.
- Updates download in the background and wait for a tap ("Update ready"), so the app never reloads mid-workout.

## Architecture

- **WorkoutCore** (`src/core`): pure TypeScript with no UI. It holds the models, database and migrations, the Strong importer, the exercise library, search, logging and every analytics formula. Tested with Vitest (`make test`).
- **Database worker** (`src/worker`): opens SQLite (WebAssembly build) on the phone's private file system and exposes WorkoutCore to the screen through one typed API.
- **Screens** (`src/app`): React, rendering only. Linear-style design tokens in CSS.
- **Storage:** SQLite, the same schema as the native app. Analytics run as SQL over 20k+ sets.
- **Units:** weights stored in kg exactly as entered, with the unit typed; display unit per exercise.

### Data model (first pass)

| Table | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `muscle` | id, name, group, region. About 20 muscles, with front/side/rear delts split |
| `exercise` | id, name ("Movement (Equipment)"), equipment, pattern, mechanic, libraryKey, lengthened-bias flag, tracking kind, source (library / custom / strong), default entry unit, archived |
| `exercise_muscle` | exercise_id, muscle_id, role (primary 1.0 / secondary 0.5) |
| `exercise_alias` | exercise_id, alias: names merged from Strong (built-in slang lives in `library.json`) |
| `workout` | id, start, end, name, notes, template_id, block_id, source (strong / app) |
| `workout_exercise` | id, workout_id, exercise_id, position, superset_group, notes |
| `set` | id, workout_exercise_id, order, type (warmup / working / drop / failure), weight_kg, entry_unit (kg / lb), reps, rpe, rir, duration_s, distance_m, side (both / L / R), rest_before_s, completed_at, notes |
| `template_folder`, `template`, `template_exercise`, `template_set` | Folders, ordered exercises, default sets/reps/RIR/rest, supersets |
| `block` | id, name, goal, start, end, notes |
| `bodyweight` | date, kg |
| `measurement` | date, site (arm L/R, chest, waist, thigh L/R, calf L/R…), cm |
| `import_mapping` | strong_name → exercise_id (saved so re-imports land the same way) |
| `progression_rule` | exercise_id, kind, params (opt-in only) |
| `equipment_profile` | plates, dumbbell list, machine steps (for the calculator) |
| `setting` | key, value |

## Milestones

Milestones are numbered W (web). W1–W3 port what the native app already had; `reference/native/` is the spec. Each milestone ends with `make verify` passing, every screen checked at iPhone 15 Pro Max size in dark and light, and a run in Safari on the simulator.

### W0: Web skeleton (done)
- Vite + React + TypeScript, ESLint layer rules, Vitest. SQLite in a worker on the phone's private file system; `v1-schema` migration; snapshot before migrating.
- Offline support and "Update ready"; Home Screen icon and manifest; design tokens (dark and light); five tabs; Settings → Appearance.

### W0b: Hosting (needs the owner)
- Publish the site on a free static host with HTTPS, then add it to the Home Screen. Deploying is one `make` command.

### W1: Strong import, History and backups
- Port units, the CSV and Strong parsers, the unit resolver, typo checks, the reviewable import plan and the importer (snapshot first, one transaction); `make import-report` on the real export must match `docs/DATA.md` exactly.
- Import flow in Settings; History list and workout detail.
- Backups: one-tap backup to Files / iCloud Drive through the share sheet; restore from a file with a safety snapshot first; last-backup date always visible.

### W2: Exercise library and search
- Port the curated library (420 exercises), seeding, name and alias resolution, custom exercises, merge, search with slang and typo tolerance, catalog queries.
- Exercises tab (browse, search, filters, detail, custom exercises) and the Strong matching screen.

### W3: Logging
- Port the logger, previous performance, the live workout query and the live typo check.
- Workout tab: previous values inline, pre-filled sets, large number pad with kg/lb toggle, finish summary, "Is this right?" prompt.
- Rest timer (on screen; alerts while locked are limited on the web, see `docs/DECISIONS.md`). Plate and warm-up calculators.

### W4: Workouts and templates
- Folders, drag to reorder, supersets, defaults per exercise, duplicate, start from a template or from any past session.
- Calendar and full history.

### W5: Analytics engine (in `WorkoutCore`, fully unit-tested)
- Effective reps E = reps + RIR (RIR = 10 − RPE; unknown → 2, lower weight).
- e1RM = w × (1 + (E − 1)/k), k by category (38 / 29 / 24 / 20 / 15). Qualifies if not a warm-up, E ≤ 12, RIR ≤ 4.
- Trend: EWMA, α = 1 − e^(−days/τ), τ 14–21 d; hold sessions >15% off the trend.
- Fractional hard sets (primary 1.0, secondary 0.5 or 0.3 setting; hard = RIR ≤ 4), zones <4 / 4–10 / 10–20 / 20–30 / >30, per-session flag >11.
- Relative intensity, rep-range buckets, RIR histogram, intensity–volume points, frequency, balance ratios, drop-off, bodyweight trend, block change (formulas in report section 12).

### W6: Analytics screens
1. **Exercise detail:** e1RM trend, rep-max table, reps at fixed load, like-for-like filters (position, rep range, rest), history.
2. **Muscles:** weekly sets direct vs indirect, body map, frequency, neglected list, balance ratios, exercise share per muscle.
3. **Intensity × volume:** rep-range mix, RIR histogram, intensity–volume map.
4. **Session summary**, **weekly report**, **block comparison**, **all-time** view.

### W7: Body
- Bodyweight with trend; measurements with L/R; strength relative to bodyweight; e1RM and bodyweight overlay.

### W8: Optional (pick later)
- Load calculator (weight for planned reps × RIR from your trend, rounded to your equipment).
- User-defined progression rules per exercise (double progression, RIR target, % e1RM, top set + back-offs), off by default.
- Stall flag with a user threshold; RIR calibration from failure sets; personal k per lift; lengthened-bias share chart.

## Roadmap: owner's requests (2026-10-30)

Short entries from the owner's review; each gets a design pass with the owner before tasks are written. Order is not decided yet.

- **R0. Charts on hold.** Don't change any chart until the owner has tried them on the phone and given feedback. Open point for that review: the Estimated 1RM headline treats a jump of more than 15% as a probable typo and holds it until confirmed. After a long break (e.g. 104.8 → 131 kg), the headline keeps showing the old value.
- **R1. Measurements page.** Its own screen (like Strong), reachable from the tab bar or Analytics. Each site has a "where and how to measure" note the owner writes (e.g. "waist: at the belly button, tape snug, relaxed"). Muscle sites can be logged **flexed and relaxed**. Tap a site → its history and chart; log a new value. Bookkeeping only, nothing fancier. *Today:* imported Strong measurements are stored (`bodyMeasurement`), but there is no screen. Replaces W7's measurement part.
- **R2. Bigger exercise library with descriptions** (and images if feasible offline). Look for an open, licence-compatible dataset to merge in; keep primary and secondary muscles, which drive the volume maths. *Today:* 420 curated exercises, no descriptions or images.
- **R3. Exercise variants.** The same movement on different machines (Panatta vs Nautilus chest press), with different grips or attachments, progresses differently. Distinct movements are already distinct exercises (bench vs incline). Open question: model a brand, grip or attachment as a variant tag that splits progression, or as separate exercises.
- **R4. Programs → workouts → exercises.** A program (e.g. "Upper/Lower") holds its workouts (e.g. "Upper A, Wednesday"), each holding exercises. *Today:* template folders → templates, and workouts started from a template remember it (`workout.templateId`), so this is largely a rename plus the analytics in R5.
- **R5. Analytics by view.**
  - **From an exercise:** performance across everything (e1RM, which is load-independent).
  - **From a workout:** progression within that workout, session to session. The same exercise done heavy on one day and light on another must not be mixed, and switching to a lighter load must not wreck the trend (Strong's weakness).
  - A program-wide overview is secondary.
- **R6. Live workout panel: keep Strong's strengths, fix its annoyances.**
  - Free order: never lock the owner into the current exercise.
  - Per-exercise notes, with room for an optional attachment (photo).
  - Rest is optional and never auto-inserted into new sets.
  - Warm-up sets are visually distinct across the whole row and excluded from volume. Failure sets, drop sets and supersets each get a clear look, not just a letter flag.
  - RPE **or** RIR entry.
  - Solid kg ↔ lb handling.
  - "Last time" shows load, reps and effort, not just the weight. Any suggestion stays opt-in (see the product rules).
  - Show the template's target reps and RPE on the live workout screen (today they appear only on the start sheet; reps prefill from last time).
  - The owner can send Strong screenshots as a reference.

## Needed from the user

- [x] Strong export (in `export_data/`, git-ignored).
- [x] **Hosting:** GitHub Pages, public repository (2026-10-30).
- [ ] Optional: Strong screenshots as UI reference.
- [ ] Preferred effort scale (RPE or RIR); app display name (currently "Workouts").

## Status

- 2026-10-29: research done, plan written. Docs and engineering rules written.
- 2026-10-29: **M0 code complete.** WorkoutCore: schema v1, snapshot-before-migrate, units (kg/lb, display snapping, entry-unit inference), backups (iCloud folder bookmark, coordinated writes, 15-min throttle, daily/monthly retention, validated restore with safety snapshot). 23 tests pass (`make test`). App: Linear-style tokens, tab shell, Settings → Backups/Restore; `make build` passes with no warnings.
  - Not yet verified: running on a simulator (no iOS simulator runtime downloaded) or on the iPhone (needs `Config/Local.xcconfig` with the team ID). The iCloud folder flow can only be checked on a real device or simulator.
  - Export profiled: per-exercise unit switching explains the odd weights (see `docs/DATA.md`). Owner's unit preference recorded: log in each exercise's unit, analytics in kg.
- 2026-10-29: **M1 code complete** (branch `m1-strong-import`). Parsers for both Strong layouts and measurement files, per-exercise unit detection, typo detection with suggestions, a reviewable import plan, an idempotent importer (snapshot first, one transaction), and history queries. App: Settings → Import from Strong (pick files → review units and flagged sets → import → result) and a live History tab with a workout detail screen. 58 tests pass; app builds with no warnings. Dry run on the real export matches it exactly (see `docs/DATA.md`).
  - Not yet verified: the import and History screens running on a device or simulator.
  - Deferred to M2: matching Strong names to library exercises (see `docs/DECISIONS.md`).
- 2026-10-30: **M2 core done** (branch `m2-exercise-library`): curated library (420 exercises), muscle taxonomy, schema v2, seeding at launch, name/alias resolution, custom exercises and merge (snapshot first), search, catalog queries. 112 tests pass; app builds. Agent workflow added (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/agents/WORKFLOW.md`, `docs/tasks/`).
  - Remaining M2 work is on the task board: Exercises tab, Strong matching screen, app icon.
- 2026-10-30: **Switched to an offline web app** (owner: no weekly reinstall). Native app archived (`native-archive` branch; spec in `reference/native/`). **W0 done** on branch `web`: SQLite in a worker on the phone's private file system, `v1-schema` migration with snapshot-before-migrate, offline support with "Update ready", design tokens in dark and light, five tabs, Settings → Appearance. 9 tests; `make verify` passes. Checked in Safari on the iPhone 15 Pro Max simulator (iOS 27.0): the database opens and persists.
  - Next: W1 tasks on the board; hosting needs the owner.
- 2026-10-30: **W1 and W2 done, W3 core done.** Strong import (matches the export exactly), History, backup and restore, exercise library with search, Exercises tab, Strong matching, logging core; 345 tests. **Live** at https://bader-almutlaq.github.io/workout-tracker/: checked in Safari on the iPhone 15 Pro Max simulator (database, Update ready, backup share sheet). Next: the Workout tab (T-024, in progress).
- 2026-10-30: **Workout tab live** (T-024): start, add exercises with last time pre-filled, number pad with kg/lb, typo prompt, finish summary. Checked end to end in Safari on the iPhone 15 Pro Max simulator against the live site. 406 tests. The app now covers what Strong did, minus templates (W4) and analytics (W5–W6). Next: backup reminder, search tie-breaks, rest timer, then templates.
- 2026-10-30: Rest timer (T-027), backup reminder (T-025) and search tie-breaks (T-026) live; migration `v2-exercise-rest-target`. 427 tests. Next: W4 templates.
- 2026-10-30: **W4 core done:** templates in folders (create, edit with your own rep ranges and RPE, supersets, start, save a workout as a template) and a History calendar. Migration `v3-templates`. 471 tests. Follow-ups in T-031. Next: analytics (W5–W6).
- 2026-10-30: **W5 core and the first W6 screens live:** e1RM and trend, hard sets per muscle, recent vs baseline (T-032, T-033); Analytics tab with the 7-day vs 28-day hard-sets chart (all training or one muscle) and weekly sets per muscle; Estimated 1RM card on each exercise (T-034 to T-036). 649 tests. Next: intensity × volume (rep-range mix, RIR histogram, intensity–volume map).
