## Layers and dependency direction

```
src/app (React screens)
        │  async calls through `database` (Comlink)
        ▼
src/worker (WorkerApi: one method per screen need)
        │  synchronous calls
        ▼
src/core (WorkoutCore: services → models → Database)
        │
        ▼
SQLite (WebAssembly) on the phone's private file system
```

- **WorkoutCore** knows nothing about React, the DOM or workers. Its TypeScript config has no DOM types, so it can't reach the screen, files or the network. It runs and tests in Node, which keeps feedback fast.
- **The worker** is the only place the live database is opened. Each `WorkerApi` method calls WorkoutCore and returns plain data (results are copied between threads). Write methods notify subscribers, so every open screen refreshes.
- **Screens** read with `useDatabaseQuery(key, () => database.someRead(...))` and write with `await database.someWrite(...)`. They hold view state only (what's selected, what's being typed).
- ESLint (`eslint.config.js`) fails the build if core imports app/worker/React, or if the app imports SQLite or `core/db`.

## Glossary (allowed abbreviations)

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| RPE | Rating of perceived exertion, 1–10 scale (Zourdos 2016) |

| Block | A user-marked training period (mesocycle) used for comparisons |
| OPFS | The browser's private file system, where the database lives on the phone |

## Concept ownership

Each concept is implemented once, in one place. When adding a concept, add a row here. Rows marked *(to port)* name the native file in `reference/native/Packages/WorkoutCore/Sources/WorkoutCore/` that specifies them.
