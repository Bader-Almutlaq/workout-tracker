/**
 * Writes a reviewed `StrongImportPlan` into the database in a single transaction (all or
 * nothing), and only ever *adds* rows. Workouts already imported (same `sourceKey`) and
 * measurements already present are skipped, so importing the same file twice changes nothing.
 * Deleted source keys in appSetting are also skipped, preserving deliberate History deletions.
 *
 * **Safety:** this function does not take a snapshot. The caller (the worker) must write a local
 * safety snapshot of the database before calling it (`docs/DATA.md` → Data safety).
 *
 * Exercises are matched to existing ones by name or saved alias (case-insensitive, see
 * `exerciseIdNamed`); unknown names become new exercises. An exercise without history takes the
 * unit Strong currently uses for it as its default entry unit. The owner's review decisions
 * (unit overrides, corrections) are already part of `plan`; rebuild the plan to change them.
 *
 * @param now Stamps the `createdAt` of exercises this import creates.
